# Receipt Upload and Image Processing Implementation

This document outlines the changes implemented for Task 4: "Build Receipt Upload and Image Processing Pipeline".

## Overview

We've implemented a complete solution for receipt image upload with preprocessing and storage directly in the database. Key features include:

1. **Receipt Upload API Endpoint**: Created FastAPI endpoint for uploading receipt images
2. **Image Processing**: Implemented image preprocessing for quality enhancement
3. **Database Storage**: Stored images directly in the database using binary columns
4. **File Validation**: Added validation for file types (JPEG, PNG, PDF) and size limits (10MB)
5. **User Association**: Connected uploads to authenticated users
6. **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite

## Key Components

### Database Model Changes
- Updated the `Receipt` model to store binary image data
- Added database migration for new columns

### Receipt Upload Service
- Created `ReceiptUploadService` for handling file validation, preprocessing, and storage
- Implemented image optimization to enhance receipt quality
- Added error handling and validation

### API Endpoint
- Created `/api/v1/receipts/upload` endpoint
- Added authentication protection
- Implemented proper error handling

### Testing
- Created unit tests for all components
- Added integration tests for the API endpoint
- Created test utilities for generating mock images

## Getting Started

### Apply Database Migrations
```
# Activate virtual environment
./apply_receipt_migrations.sh
```

### Run Tests
```
# Run receipt upload tests
./test_receipt_upload.sh
```

### Manual Testing
```
# For manual API testing:
./test_receipt_upload_script.py
```
Note: You need to add your Auth0 token to the script before running it.

## Next Steps
1. Integrate this with Task 5 for processing uploaded receipts with LLM
2. Create UI components for receipt upload
3. Implement receipt image preview and management features
