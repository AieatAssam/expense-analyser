# Overview  
Expense analyser implements mechanism for analysing receipts and other expenses in an intuitive and easy manner.
It utilises AI (defaults to gemini-2.5-flash but can work and be configured to work with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) to perform OCR and extract data from receipts, categorise all purchases into various shopping categories (focused on grocery and household goods types of purchases).
Web application includes detailed analytics for spending and is designed to help end users track their spending and analyse where they are spending the money.

# Core Features  
## AI Receipt Parsing
- Uses LLMs to parse receipts into JSON
- Much more powerful than traditional OCR scanning
- Categorises all lines on the receipt and produces detailed list of items purchased

## Data Storage
Uses PostgresQL database to store purchase information for analytics

## analytics
Detailed anlytic graphs are produced to describe
- Spend per category
- Spending trends
- Month-by-month comparison
- Running Averages
- other useful staticstics

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- Primary: Individuals who do regular grocery and household shopping
- Needs: Track spending habits, understand expense patterns, and gain financial insights
- Behavior: Will upload receipts after shopping trips, check monthly reports periodically

## Key User Flows
1. **Receipt Upload and Processing**
   - User uploads photo/scan of receipt
   - System processes receipt via AI and extracts line items
   - User reviews extracted data and confirms/edits if needed
   - System categorizes items and updates analytics

2. **Expense Dashboard**
   - User views current month's spending breakdown
   - User compares spending with previous months
   - User drills down into specific shopping sessions/receipts
   - User explores spending by category

3. **Data Export**
